## **What is Syne?**

Syne is a high level programming language being developed using C++ and Python. It aims to create fast, efficient and readable code

## Why is it being developed?

In the modern day, people don't prefer to choose 3rd generation languages because of the difficulty involved in understanding the syntax and using them in modern day applications. Through Syne, we use low level languages in collaboration with high level languages to develop a programming language that is nearly as fast as old languages while keeps the code readable and quite easy to analyse.

## Current Progress
- [x] Syntax(somewhat similar to Ruby)
- [x] Core Libraries
- [ ] Integration of networking libraries
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Basic Packages
